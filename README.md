CS571: Natural Language Processing
=====

This is a graduate course focusing on topics in natural Language processing. This course covers natural language processing tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, dependency parsing, coreference resolution, entity linking, semantic parsing, sentiment analysis, distributional semantics, and question answering, as well as machine learning techniques such as adaptive gradient descent, structured prediction, dataset aggregation, convolutional and recurrent neural networks. Computational grammars such as context-free grammar, tree-adjoining grammar, combinatory categorial grammar, and head-driven grammar, as well as meaning representations such as PropBank, FrameNet, VerbNet, WordNet, and AMR are also discussed. Prerequisites: undergraduate level of artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, information retrieval, or their equivalence.
